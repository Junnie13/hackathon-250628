🎤 Pitch Script: Quotable — AI for Smarter International Funnels
(Timer: ~0:00–0:30)
Hi everyone, I’m [Your Name], and this is Quotable — your AI-powered engine for smarter international marketing.
We help businesses break into new markets, generate high-quality leads, and optimize outbound campaigns — not just by analyzing what happened, but by prescribing exactly what to do next.

(Timer: ~0:30–1:15)

🚧 The Problem
Right now, international lead generation is mostly guesswork.

Companies buy bloated lead lists or mass-send emails hoping someone bites.

Campaigns fail due to tone mismatch, timing errors, or weak targeting — and no one knows why.

Worse, even if something works, teams don’t know how to repeat that success elsewhere.

Businesses need a smarter, scalable, prescriptive way to generate leads and optimize campaigns across cultures and regions.

(Timer: ~1:15–2:00)

💡 The Solution: Quotable
Quotable is an AI-powered outbound marketing system that automates and improves every stage of the funnel:

Scrapes leads from Google Maps and LinkedIn using open data and Crawl4AI

Evaluates them using AI agents with RAG to confirm industry and decision-making power

Generates tailored emails based on role, geography, and cultural tone

Tracks campaign performance — opens, clicks, responses

Diagnoses why campaigns succeed or fail, and

Prescribes improved campaigns using benchmarked patterns

It’s not just smart outreach — it’s self-improving outreach.

(Timer: ~2:00–2:45)

🧠 Why AI Makes This Possible
At the core are AI agents powered by GPT-4 and LangChain:

A Lead Evaluator Agent filters out non-decision-makers

A Campaign Optimizer Agent generates culturally adaptive emails

A Prescriptive Engine learns from past campaigns to recommend new content, timing, and segmentation strategies

And everything is grounded in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), so the AI is always citing real data from scraped profiles and uploaded campaign reports.

(Timer: ~2:45–3:30)

📊 Real-World Use Case
Let’s say you want to target insurance executives in Singapore.

Quotable scrapes leads from Google Maps and LinkedIn.

Filters for verified decision-makers in the insurance vertical.

Automatically generates an outreach email — formal tone, risk-reduction value prop, and CTA that aligns with cultural preferences.

Tracks opens, clicks, replies — and if performance dips?

The AI explains why and prescribes a better version for the next round.

No more shooting in the dark. Just smarter funnels.

(Timer: ~3:30–4:30)

🧱 What We Built for the MVP
In this MVP, we’ve implemented:

Lead scraping via MCP and Puppeteer

Lead evaluation using AI + RAG

Email generation with GPT-4

A live campaign sent via Gmail SMTP (for demo)

Campaign performance analytics (mock data)

And a closed-loop prescriptive engine that improves future campaigns based on prior results

We’ll demo a full cycle: scrape → evaluate → email → measure → optimize — all in minutes.

(Timer: ~4:30–5:00)

Global expansion shouldn't mean global guessing.

Quotable enables businesses to target smarter, message better, and convert faster in any market — all with minimal guesswork and maximal AI guidance.
