Project Name: Quotable

Tagline: New Markets. Smarter Funnels. More Quotes.

1. Overview

Quotable is an AI-powered MVP designed to revolutionize international lead generation and marketing campaign optimization. Instead of relying on purchased lead lists and manual A/B campaigns, Quotable scrapes and qualifies high-value leads, automates targeted outreach, and continuously improves campaign performance through prescriptive analytics.

The goal is to offer a systematic and iterative workflow that leverages AI to:

Scrape and evaluate leads from public sources

Launch AI-personalized email campaigns

Track and analyze performance

Diagnose failures and predict campaign ROI

Optimize content based on cultural and behavioral insights

This MVP focuses on outbound email campaigns in the insurance vertical, targeting decision-makers internationally.

2. Core Features (MVP Scope)

1. Lead Scraping (Automated Collection)

Scrape leads from:

Google Maps (via MCP protocol or Puppeteer headless browser)

LinkedIn (Crawl4AI for scalable phase 2)

Extract key attributes:

Name, title, company, location, email (if exposed), and LinkedIn URL

Validate against insurance vertical keywords

2. Lead Evaluation (Filtering & Enrichment)

Use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to:

Analyze uploaded lead source docs or scraped profiles

Identify if the lead is a decision-maker

Confirm if the company operates in insurance or adjacent verticals

3. Campaign Automation (Outbound Email)

GPT-generated email templates

Personalize by lead role, country, and culture (via system prompt)

Add dynamic sections based on prior performance metrics

Send emails via SMTP integration (for demo, Gmail SMTP + your email)

Track:

Open rate, click-through, response

Traffic from links (if available)

4. Campaign Performance Analysis (Descriptive)

Use mock or actual campaign data to:

Show performance per campaign, per persona, and per market

Visualize email funnel drop-offs

Aggregate click/open rates by country

5. Root Cause Analysis (Diagnostic)

Analyze what led to poor campaign results:

Language tone mismatch (use sentiment analysis)

Timing / send window failures

Missing personalization or cultural context

6. Predictive Benchmarking (Predictive)

Estimate future open/click/conversion rates using prior campaign data

Set industry and geography benchmarks using:

External datasets (e.g. Mailchimp public reports)

Your demo results as baseline

7. Prescriptive Optimization (Prescriptive)

Generate improved campaigns emails to send to future leads using:

AI system prompts tuned by geography/culture

Past campaign performance (top 20% open rate patterns)

Output: Campaign template suggestions, send time windows, CTAs

5. System Prompts for AI Agents

Prompt: Lead Qualification Agent

You are an AI lead evaluator. Given a personâ€™s job title, company, and context, assess whether they are a decision-maker in the insurance industry. Return:
- Role level: Decision-maker / Influencer / Not relevant
- Industry match: Insurance / Adjacent / Not relevant
- Confidence score (0-1)

Prompt: Campaign Optimizer Agent

You are an AI campaign strategist. Given prior campaign results, location, and cultural tone preferences, generate an optimized email with:
- Custom greeting & CTA
- Tone (formal/informal)
- Structure based on top-performing layout
- Dynamic section if prior campaign was ignored

6. AI Guardrails (MVP)

Ensure no hallucinated emails, roles, or companies (validate input)

Limit automation: every email generated is reviewed by a marketer before sending (until accuracy is stable)

Do not suggest regions without scraping coverage

Cultural tone adjustments must use pre-approved templates or structures

Benchmarks should come from real or published data only (no fabricated insights)
