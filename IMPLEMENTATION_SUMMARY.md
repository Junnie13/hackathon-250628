## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Architecture

The application follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
  lib/
    config.ts         # Environment variable validation and access
    supabase.ts       # Supabase client configuration
    openai.ts         # OpenAI API integration
    email.ts          # Email sending and tracking
    scraper.ts        # Lead scraping and evaluation
    campaigns.ts      # Campaign management and execution
    analytics.ts      # Performance analysis and optimization
    index.ts          # Service exports
```

### Mock Implementation

For the MVP, we've implemented mock functionality for:
- Lead scraping (simulated with realistic data)
- Email sending (simulated with success/failure responses)
- Analytics (using realistic mock data)

In a production environment, these would be connected to actual APIs and services.

### Security Considerations

- Environment variables are used for all sensitive information
- API keys are never exposed in the client-side code
- Validation ensures all required configuration is present

## Conclusion

The foundation phase of the Quotable app has been successfully implemented, providing the core services and functionality required for the application. The UI components have been connected to these services, creating a functional application with real-time data processing and AI-powered features. The next steps involve enhancing the user experience, adding more detailed features, and preparing for production deployment.
