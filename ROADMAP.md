    C --> L[Analytics Data]
    end
    
    F --> J
    G --> K
    H --> L
```

### Security Implementation

To safely store secret keys when pushing to GitHub, we'll implement the following:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file for local development that contains all sensitive information
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed
   - Create a `.env.example` file with placeholder values as a template

2. **Environment Variable Structure**
   ```
   # .env (DO NOT COMMIT)
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_USER=your_email_service_user
   VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_PASS=your_email_service_password
   ```

3. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Implement validation to ensure all required environment variables are present
   - Add clear error messages when variables are missing

4. **Secure Access in Code**
   - Access environment variables through a centralized config file
   - Implement proper error handling for missing variables

5. **Example Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/config.ts
   
   interface Config {
     supabase: {
       url: string;
       anonKey: string;
     };
     openai: {
       apiKey: string;
     };
     email: {
       user: string;
       pass: string;
     };
   }
   
   const validateEnvVar = (name: string): string => {
     const value = import.meta.env[name];
     if (!value) {
       throw new Error(`Missing environment variable: ${name}`);
     }
     return value;
   };
   
   export const config: Config = {
     supabase: {
       url: validateEnvVar('VITE_SUPABASE_URL'),
       anonKey: validateEnvVar('VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'),
     },
     openai: {
       apiKey: validateEnvVar('VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY'),
     },
     email: {
       user: validateEnvVar('VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_USER'),
       pass: validateEnvVar('VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_PASS'),
     },
   };
   ```

## Feature Implementation Priority

To ensure a balanced approach between UI completion and AI feature implementation, we'll prioritize features as follows:

### High Priority (Implement First)
1. Lead scraping UI and basic functionality
2. Campaign creation and management
3. Basic email generation with OpenAI
4. Performance dashboard with mock data
5. Supabase integration for data storage

### Medium Priority
1. Lead evaluation with RAG
2. Email sending functionality
3. Campaign performance tracking
4. Cultural adaptation features
5. Root cause analysis

### Lower Priority (Implement Last)
1. Advanced RAG implementation
2. Predictive benchmarking
3. A/B testing framework
4. Advanced optimization suggestions
5. Comprehensive analytics

## Development Guidelines

To avoid hallucinations and maintain focus during development:

1. **Follow the Feature Roadmap**
   - Stick to the prioritized feature list
   - Complete one feature before moving to the next
   - Regularly check progress against the roadmap

2. **Use Mock Data Strategically**
   - Create realistic mock data for development
   - Ensure mock data covers edge cases
   - Gradually replace mock data with real data

3. **Implement Incremental AI Features**
   - Start with basic AI implementations
   - Test thoroughly before enhancing
   - Document AI behavior and limitations

4. **Maintain Clear Boundaries**
   - Separate UI, business logic, and data access
   - Use typed interfaces between components
   - Document component responsibilities

5. **Regular Testing**
   - Test each feature as it's implemented
   - Conduct integration testing regularly
   - Validate AI outputs against expectations

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the Quotable app, balancing UI completion with AI feature implementation. By following this plan, the development process will remain focused and efficient, avoiding hallucinations and deviations from the core requirements.

The roadmap is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments as development progresses and new insights emerge. Regular reviews of progress against the roadmap will help ensure the project stays on track and delivers a high-quality product that meets the requirements outlined in the PRD.
